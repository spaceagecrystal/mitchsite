<div class="resHeaderA">Bio</div>

<div class="resParagraph">
Mitch Greer is an artist living and working in Berkeley, CA. He was born in Texas in 1977. He studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Inspired by science fiction, fairy tales, and myth, Mitch explores through traditional materials and technology, the shared space between the mystical, imagined, and scientific aspects of the contemporary world. From 2005-2012, working as International Corporation, Mitch designed and produced multimedia and sound works, performing and exhibiting as part of the duo The Lickets at the Olympia Experimental Music Festival in 2009, and at Issue Project Room in New York in 2010. In 2013, Mitch eponymously exhibited at the Limner Gallery in Hudson, NY and Platform in Santa Barbara, CA.

<div class="resHeaderA">Statement</div>

<div class="resParagraph">
My early instinct to create things came from a state of flow and intuition. Though later I began to make films, recordings, paintings, sculpture and design, I still find the instinct for art making comes from these early experiences of making connections between seemingly disparate sources and being surprised. I question the difference between the formal requirements of contemporary art making and more natural states of making, and non-utilitarian ideation and processes of envisioning like that of dream and memory. I explore these intersections of cognitive states, and as a result I am influenced by the forms of art manifested in folk, spiritual, popular and religious traditions.
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<div class="resParagraph">
In the course of art making, influenced by the freedom of mediation between artist and audience in anonymous art, I have explored identity by creating pseudonyms and invented biographies, in many different forms, especially under the name International Corporation. In this way I explore the grotesque, craft arts, new materials and street art, and under different encapsulations of artistic identity, turn to the expansive, cosmic, vast, meditative, reflective, atmospheric, and intuitive aspects of art.
