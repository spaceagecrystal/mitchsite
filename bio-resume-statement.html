<div class="resHeaderA">Bio</div>

<div class="resParagraph">
Mitch Greer is an intermedia artist and filmmaker living and working in Berkeley, CA. Inspired by science fiction, fairy tales, and myth, Greer explores the shared space between the mystical, imagined, and scientific aspects of the contemporary world. Working under the name International Corporation, Greer designs and produces multimedia and sound works independently and also in collaboration with Rachel Smith. The duo performed and exhibited as The Lickets at the Olympia Experimental Music Festival in 2009, at Issue Project Room in New York in 2010, Garden of Memory at the Chapel of the Chimes in 2016 and KZSU Stanfordâ€™s Day of Noise 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. Greer has exhibited internationally since 2013. Greer was born in Texas in 1977 and studied art at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and San Francisco Art Institute.

<div class="resHeaderA">Statement</div>

<div class="resParagraph">
I am interested in alternative states of art making, non-objective ideation and processes of envisioning like that of dream and memory. My explorations of these intersecting cognitive states are influenced by mythological, narrative, folk, spiritual, popular and religious traditions of art. My early instinct to create things came from the influence of popular animated films and the state of disruption and disreality these films had in anonymous suburban culture. Later I developed an interest in flow-states, stream of consciousness and intuition that manifested into drawings and collage. I subsequently began to make films, recordings, paintings, sculpture and design in both analog and digital media. I still find the instinct for art making comes from states similar to my early experiences of making and I question the idea that there is a significant difference between them and the formal requirements of contemporary media.

<div class="clear"></div>
<div class="resParagraph">
Attracted by the freedom of mediation between artist and audience in anonymous art, I have explored different artistic identities by creating pseudonyms and invented biographies to accompany different bodies of work. Particularly important in this respect is my collaboration with Rachel Smith under the name International Corporation. In this way I explore the grotesque, craft arts, new materials and street art, and under different encapsulations of artistic identity, open to forms of expanded consciousness through the intuitive aspects of art.
